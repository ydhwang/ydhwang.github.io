This year I have been selected as a recipient of [Statistics in Physical Engineering Sciences Award](http://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Awards/Statistics-in-Physical-Engineering-Sciences-Award.aspx). 

I have been fortunate to be able to work with many great researchers throughout my career, and my longtime collaboration with Drs Kyongmin Yeo and Xiao Liu is one of them.
