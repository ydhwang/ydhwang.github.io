This year I have been selected as a recipient of [Statistics in Physical Engineering Sciences Award](http://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Awards/Statistics-in-Physical-Engineering-Sciences-Award.aspx) with Drs. Kyongmin Yeo and Xiao Liu. It is an annual award from American Statistical Association.

I have been fortunate to be able to work with many great researchers throughout my career, and my longtime collaboration with Kyongmin and Xiao is one of them.
