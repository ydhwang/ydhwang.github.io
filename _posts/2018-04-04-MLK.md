50 years ago today, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis. Although we have come a long way, but his message is more important than ever in these dire times:

>>  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.

Everyone is human. Everyone is somebody. Let's treat everyone accordingly.
