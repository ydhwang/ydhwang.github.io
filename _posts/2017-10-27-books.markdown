1. [An Accidental Statistician](https://www.amazon.com/Accidental-Statistician-Life-Memories-George/dp/1118400887/) A wonderful memoir by an amazing statistician. I'm deeply influenced by George Box legacy at Wisconsin. A pleasant reading by a wonderful writer. 

1. [A Conversation with Jeff Wu](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1484816590) Chien-Fu Jeff Wu is the most influential figure in engineering statistician after Box, in my humble opinion. He has an incredible sense of humor and wit. 

1. [The Lady Tasting Tea](https://www.amazon.com/Lady-Tasting-Tea-Statistics-Revolutionized/dp/0805071342/ref=pd_cp_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=98Z7QMCA85HYHPG46RK8) I don't have as much of personal attachment to this book as I do toward the first two, but it's a fun read.
