[Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/blog/) is a statistician at UW-Madison. I had very limited interaction with him when I was student there--except one invited session of Statistical consulting class organized by [Doug Bates](https://github.com/dmbates) who taught the course in 2010 Spring semester. And as almost every statistician/mathematician, I'm not particularly social so I didn't get to know him much. 

A long after I left Madison, I become to come across his name a lot. His research area--statistical genetics--usually involves heavy computing, and he is one of those who're actively advocating the reproducible research. And so am I. 

Anyway today he posted a great piece on [learning a new programming language](http://kbroman.org/blog/2018/03/16/learning-a-new-programming-language/). In particular, I can't agree more with this point: **Have a particular goal/application in mind.** Learning a new language (or any language) is difficult unless you have a specific goal. Most books on language start with the definition and how it is to be specified, but over the course.. the readers get bored. That's not how we learn a new language. 

We should start with setting a specific goal. In learning R, say, "I'd like to make this plot from this data set." It is hard not to slip when starting with "vectors" and "scalars." 

So for those who are interested in pursuing a professional career as a statistician, go and read his post. Or maybe the entire blog.
