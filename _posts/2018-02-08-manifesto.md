Statisticians are being called in various forms these days -- data scientists and all that. Statistics serves as the science for science via providing ways to analyze the new forms of data and extract the most relevant insight from the available data, while minimizing the risk of jumping into a wrong conclusion or misinterpreting the value of the data. That is the public calling of statisticians. To serve the pubic appropriately, we also need some help from the public. 

All information must be provided to the public in a way that guarantees the access to the  broadest population. Any barriers preventing such access, unless absolutely necessary for the public safety, should be rid of. Examples include the current practice in this country forcing the use of a particular operating system (i.e., Windows) or word processor software (i.e., Hancom office). It is so often the case that the environment of the end user is assumed to be the most convenient for the developer or the provider. It is wrong. Especially in today's world, the information should be accessible through all possible platforms -- mobile, Linux, MacOS, or even Blackberry. 

Information should not be delivered through the formats that are not easy to be paired with an automated algorithm. For example, data table should be provided in a text form (via API or html format) not the .pdf or, even worse, .hwp attachment. In particular, .hwp format had not been open until very recently, and currently it is a complete mess.
